# Louis' dotfiles

This organisation is a way for me to group my [dotfiles](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Dotfiles) on [Github](https://github.com/Louis-dotfiles), it is a workaround the lack of proper groups on the platform.

The actual README displayed in Github is in [./profile/README.md](./profile/README.md).
