# Louis' dotfiles

This organisation is a way for me to group my [dotfiles](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Dotfiles) on [Github](https://github.com/Louis-dotfiles), it is a workaround the lack of proper groups on the platform.

# TODOs

- Nixos
- Home-manager
- Nvim
- Zsh
- Git?
- Alacritty?
- Starship.rs
- Awesome
