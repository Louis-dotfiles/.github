# Louis' dotfiles

This organisation is a way for me to group my
[dotfiles](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Dotfiles) on
[Github](https://github.com/Louis-dotfiles), it is a workaround the lack of
proper groups on the platform.

## Configurations

You can use my dotfiles for individual programs / utilities:
- [Alacritty](https://github.com/louis-dotfiles/alacritty) terminal emulator.
- [Git](https://github.com/louis-dotfiles/git) version control system.
- [Neovim](https://github.com/louis-dotfiles/neovim) editor.
- [Starship](https://github.com/louis-dotfiles/starship) prompt.
- [ZSH](https://github.com/louis-dotfiles/zsh) shell.

Or you can use the installer to setup everything at once:
[Dotbot dotfiles installer](https://github.com/louis-dotfiles/dotbot-dotfiles).

## TODOs
